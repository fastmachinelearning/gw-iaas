    Queries the Triton metrics endpoint at potentially

    and throughput statistics at intervals for analyzing
    server performance. Standard Triton conventions for
    port mapping are expected: gRPC requests to port 8001
    and metrics requests to port 8002. Data is recorded to
    a csv file with columns for (in order)
        - the time at which the metrics are queried
        - the ip address metrics were queried from
        - the model to which this row of metrics apply
        - the ID of the GPU to which this row of metrics apply
        - the number of inference executions of that model
            on that GPU which occured since the last query
        - the time requests spent queueing for inference on
            that model on that GPU since the last query in

            microseconds
        - the time spent populating the model output tensor
            for that model on that GPU since the last query
            in microseconds
        - the total time spent executing all inference
            processes for that model on that GPU since the
            lsat query in microseconds

    Ensemble models are implicitly divided into their
    constituent models for analysis. It's worth noting for
    now that steps in an ensemble model that neglect to
    specify a version will use version 1 by default (
    **NOT** the latest version). This is a known limitation
    that is in the process of being fixed.

        model_name:

        ips:
            The IP addresses of Triton servers from which
            to query inference metrics. If a string, only
            that IP address will have its metrics queried.
        filename:
            The name of the file to which to write results in
            CSV format
        model_version:
